## ABOUT

Second attempt (after some file structure issues) creating a weather App using React, utilizing Hooks ( { useEffect, useState }) to manage state and handle the rendering and loading of the app. This is my first time using Semantic UI for some predefined components, namely the refresh button and the loading wheel.  I used my OpenWeather API key to make the API calls, and Moment.js for displaying the date and time.  My file structure mistake on the first attempt was naming the directory file a second time in the Git Bash command line when creating the React app inside the GitHub repo.  The correct solution was to use the command ``` npx create-react-app . ``` at the outset.
